# Horiseon Digital Marketing Website Refactor

I have created this project to complete the first homework assignment in my part-time full-stack coding bootcamp at UT.

The assignment requires me to refactor the code for the Horiseon Marketing website using Semantic HTML, so that the website follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

This is the User Story:

    AS A marketing agency
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
    
This is the Acceptance Critera:

    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the icon and image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
